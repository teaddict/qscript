/*Sigma X, also known as Pauli X gate, is a quantum equivalent of bit negation. Since qubits are represented by complex numbers, there is no simple concept of negation for them. Sigma Y and Sigma Z gates "negate" qubits in alternative ways.

CNot 0, 1
/*
CNot	Controlled NOT gate applies the same transformation as Sigma X gate, except that its execution is conditioned on the value of the first argument - control qubit. The quantum negation is only performed on states where the control qubit has value 1. States where control qubit has value 0 remain unchanged.

Toffoli 1, 2, 3
/*
Toffoli	Toffoli gate operates in the same way as controlled NOT gate, taking two control qubits and the target qubit. Negation is only performed on states where both control qubits have value 1.
